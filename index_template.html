            <p>There are many ways that a cyclist might leave a stage race. Some become injured in one of the many avoidable crashes that inevitably happens, others sick and so unsafe to ride with. Others still decide to cut their losses and rest up for whatever is coming next. The saddest, in my opinion, is failing to make the time cut.</p>
            <p>The time cut is designed to remove riders who aren't quite making the grade.</p>
